Dependincies:

- python 3.x (might work in 2.x, idk)
- websocket (https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/) (required)
	- with numpy for acceleration (optional; slower websockets without)
- requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) (optional; disables some http functionality without)

```
pip install websocket_client numpy requests
```

also need to install Python certificates to get it to work
